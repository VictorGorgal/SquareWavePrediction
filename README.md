# SquareWavePrediction
Simple LSTM neural-network to predict a square wave function

Similar to the Sine Wave Prediction project, this project is a precursor for the Energy Consumption Forecast.  

- generator.py - generates the square wave
- nn.py - trains and saves the model to file
- prediction.py - makes new predictions using the saved model

The model consists of 4 layers; 16, 1, 16, 1 neurons respectively.
